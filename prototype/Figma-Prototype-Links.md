## Notes
- Set Figma sharing to **Anyone with the link → Can view** (no sign-in needed).  
- Keep thumbnails in the repo (e.g., `First Lo-fi Prototype.jpg`) so the preview works.  
- Add more prototypes as bullets here; keep numbering consistent.  
- Use unique thumbnails (e.g., `Healthy-Eating-Lo-fi.jpg`) if available for clarity.
