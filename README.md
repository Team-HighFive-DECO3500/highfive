## How to Run / Use

The prototype currently runs **locally** and can be opened directly in a web browser — there is no online deployment yet.

### Option 1 — Run with Live Server (Recommended)
1. Download or clone this repository.  
2. Open the project folder in **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**.  
3. Install the **Live Server** extension (if not already installed).  
4. Right-click on `index.html` → select **“Open with Live Server.”**  
5. The prototype will open in your default browser.  

This is the simplest and most reliable way to preview the app and interact with its core features (e.g., Task Manager, Supply Stock, and House Notes).

### Option 2 — Run via npm (if dependencies are set up)
1. Open the project folder in your terminal.  
2. Run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
