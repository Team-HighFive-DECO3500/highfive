# **Overview**

**KitchenKat** is a digital wall-mounted display designed to make household coordination in shared student accommodation **effortless and fair**.  
Instead of relying on forgotten WhatsApp messages or overlooked fridge notes, KitchenKat provides a **persistent, ambient interface** that helps housemates manage kitchen tasks, track supplies, and stay aware of household activities — all **without nagging, surveillance, or extra effort**.

# **The Problem**

## Students living in sharehouses face constant coordination challenges:

- **Invisible labour:** Some housemates do more work while others don’t realize what needs doing.  
- **Decision fatigue:** *“What should we cook?”* paralysis leads to expensive takeaway defaults.  
- **Supply chaos:** Essentials run out or go to waste because no one tracks inventory.  
- **Cleanup friction:** Post-cooking mess deters shared cooking that could save money and build community.  
- **Communication gaps:** Group chats get cluttered, fridge notes get ignored, and tension builds.

Current tools aren’t designed for the messy reality of shared living — they either demand **too much effort** (complex chore apps no one maintains) or provide **too little structure** (chats where key info gets buried).

# **Our Solution**

**KitchenKat** sits quietly in the background as a wall-mounted display in shared kitchens, making coordination **visible but not intrusive**.

---

## **Core Features**

### **Task Manager**
- Create, assign, and track household tasks with clear priorities.  
- Drag-and-drop completion makes finishing tasks satisfying.  
- Everyone can see who’s doing what, preventing both duplicated effort and invisible labour.

### **SupplyWorm**
- Report and track supply issues (*running low*, *empty*, *expired*) with urgency indicators.  
- Attribution shows who noticed problems, distributing the mental load fairly across the household.

### **House Notes**
- Leave persistent reminders and updates that don’t get lost in chat scrolls.  
- Enables simple, visible communication for the little things that matter.

### **Smart Alerts**
- Connected to smart kitchen sensors (e.g., bins) that detect when something needs attention.  
- Example: *“Bin is full — needs taking out — Kiran”* appears with friendly attribution.

### **Activity Traces**
- Show recent activities for gentle accountability and recognition.  
- Makes everyone’s contributions visible, promoting fairness and appreciation.

## **Design Principles**

KitchenKat is guided by key principles from **social and mobile computing** research:

- **Awareness without surveillance:** Visibility of work without judgment or tracking.  
- **Immediate individual value:** Each interaction benefits the user personally, not just the group.  
- **Asynchronous coordination:** Supports different schedules — no need for meetings or live chat.  
- **Fair work distribution:** Makes invisible labour visible and ensures shared contribution.  
- **Calm technology:** Information is present when needed, invisible when not.

## **Who It’s For**

- **Students** in shared accommodation juggling classes, work, and social lives.  
- **Young professionals** in sharehouses navigating communal living for the first time.  
- **Any household** where coordination feels harder than it should be.

---

## **Development Journey**

KitchenKat emerged from **research into healthy eating habits** among university students.  
We discovered the barrier wasn’t lack of nutrition knowledge — it was the **lack of coordination infrastructure**.  

Through **interviews, literature review**, and **iterative prototyping informed by CSCW theory**, the concept evolved from a complex cooking app into a focused coordination tool.

### **Key Milestones**
1. **Research Phase:** Identified coordination pain points in shared kitchens.  
2. **Initial Prototype:** Featured scanning, groups, and recipe features (too complex).  
3. **Design Pivot:** Simplified system based on evaluation and theoretical reflection.  
4. **Current Prototype:** Focused on task coordination and supply management.  
5. **Tradeshow Exhibition:** Gathered public feedback and iterated further.

## **Project Vision**

> *“Technology should make shared living easier, not add another thing to manage.”*

KitchenKat keeps the kitchen in flow by making coordination **visible, fair, and effortless**.  
We believe good design should **fade into the background**, supporting daily rhythms without demanding attention or creating friction.  
KitchenKat embodies technology that **serves people — not the other way around.**
