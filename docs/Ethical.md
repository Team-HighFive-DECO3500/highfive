# Ethical Considerations
1. Overview

KitchenKat is a social and mobile system designed to coordinate shared household tasks such as cooking, shopping, and cleaning. Because it collects and displays users’ contributions within a shared living context, it raises several ethical concerns related to privacy, consent, representation, and social pressure. This section reflects on the ethical risks and their potential implications for users and the design.

2. Data Privacy and Consent

The system collects limited data—names, task completion status, and notifications—to coordinate shared activities. However, even minimal data can expose behavioral patterns (e.g., who cleans most often or who delays tasks).
Ethical risk: Overexposure of user actions may create a sense of surveillance or peer pressure.
Reflection: Data collection must remain transparent, with users clearly informed about what is stored and who can view it. Consent should be explicit and revocable, allowing users to opt out or delete their records. Anonymous or aggregated task data could further reduce sensitivity.

3. Fair Representation

Unequal distribution of household labor is a common source of conflict in shared living. If not carefully designed, KitchenKat might unintentionally reinforce existing biases (e.g., assumptions that certain users—often women or more responsible housemates—will complete more tasks).
Ethical risk: The interface could normalize imbalanced responsibility by simply recording it rather than addressing it.
Reflection: The design should promote equity, for example by visualizing contributions fairly, suggesting balanced rotations, and avoiding any ranking or punitive scoring that might stigmatize individuals.

4. Informed Participation

As KitchenKat is both a shared display and a mobile tool, all participants must understand how their data and actions are visible to others.
Ethical risk: Users might be added to the system or assigned tasks without clear consent or awareness of how visibility works.
Reflection: Participation must be voluntary, and onboarding should include a clear explanation of visibility settings and notification controls. Each user should have equal ability to manage their role and privacy preferences.

5. Social and Emotional Implications

Although visibility can encourage accountability, it may also create social tension if contributions are compared too explicitly. Public displays risk shaming or isolating less active participants.
Reflection: The system should frame reminders and feedback positively—acknowledging efforts rather than penalizing inactivity—and avoid gamification that could amplify guilt or competition. Subtle, supportive cues are ethically preferable to public comparisons.

6. Summary

Ethical design for KitchenKat requires balancing accountability with autonomy. The system should make shared work visible enough to promote fairness but not so transparent that it becomes intrusive. Respect for user consent, fairness, and emotional well-being must remain central throughout prototyping, evaluation, and deployment.
