# Design Process

## Design Opportunity

From our research we saw opportunities to:

- Reduce decision fatigue with shared meal planning.
- Save time/money through collective shopping and cooking.
- Motivate with group challenges.
- Ensure fairness by tracking contributions.

**Refined Opportunity:**  
A display + mobile system to coordinate household tasks (shopping, cooking, cleaning), with reminders and visible contribution tracking for fairness and accountability.

## Early Concepts

### Concept 1: Fridge-Mounted Ingredient Screen

- Show recipes based on fridge contents.
- **Problem:** too individual, risked becoming “just another recipe app.”

### Concept 2: Shared Scale + Ingredient Display

- Shared kitchen scale with ingredient board.
- **Problem:** too confusing, recipes felt abstract, lacked social motivation.

### Concept 3: Collaboration Display Board (Pivot)

- Shared task board + mobile notifications.
- **Why it worked:** addressed forgetfulness, built accountability, reinforced fairness.

## Prototyping Journey

- **Low-fidelity:** sketches of group selection, task assignment, completion.
- **Medium-fidelity:** Figma prototypes; iterations added clearer task assignment and fairness tracking.
- **Feedback:** users valued fairness + reminders more than recipes. Described it as “a shared calendar but specific to house tasks.”

**Next Steps:** build higher-fidelity prototype with notifications + shared display.
