# Evaluation 1 - KitchenKat

## KitchenKat Evaluation Protocol

## 1. Evaluation Methodology

## Think Aloud Protocol with Post-Interview
We have decided to use Think Aloud method combined with semi-structured post-interview questions as our evaluation methodology. This approach well-suited for evaluating KitchenKat's social and mobile computing dimensions.

## Rationale for Think Aloud Protocol

### Why Think Aloud?

Think aloud protocol is an evaluation method where participants verbalize their thoughts, feelings, and actions while interacting with the system (Ericsson & Simon, 1993). For KitchenKat, this method offers several advantages:

1. Captures thought process and mental models
Think aloud reveals users' expectations, confusions, and decision-making processes as they happen (Nielsen, 1993). Since KitchenKat expects to provide ambient awareness (Schmidt, 2002) and calm technology (Weiser, 1991), we need to understand whether users naturally understand the system's information architecture without extra guidance. The protocol allows us to identify situations or moments where the design successfully fades into the background versus moments where it requires unexpected cognitive effort.


2. Reveals Social Interpretation
KitchenKat is fundamentally a social coordination tool designed to make invisible articulation work visible (Kraal, 2014). Think aloud helps us understand how users interpret social cues embedded in the interface - such as task attribution, presence indicators (avatars), and activity feeds. As users verbalize their reactions to seeing housemates' contributions, we gain insight into whether the design successfully promotes social translucence (Erickson & Kellogg, 2000) or inadvertently creates pressure and discomfort.


3. Contextual Interaction Insights
Our system operates across multiple contexts - both as a physical kitchen wall-mounted device and through mobile notifications. Think aloud allows us to observe how users navigate this ubicomp environment (Weiser, 1991; Abowd & Mynatt, 2000) and understand their context-switching behaviors. Participants' verbalizations reveal their mental models about when and how to use different interaction modalities.

4. Uncovers Fairness Perceptions
A core design goal is addressing Grudin's disparity problem (1988, 1994) - ensuring those who do the work receive recognition. Think aloud captures participants' immediate reactions to fairness mechanisms like task attribution ("reported by Emma") and visible contribution tracking. Their spontaneous comments reveal whether these features feel motivating, fair, stressful, or potentially divisive.

5. Identifies Mobile Micro-Interaction Patterns
Think aloud is particularly effective for evaluating mobile micro-interactions (Oulasvirta et al., 2005) - the quick, glanceable actions KitchenKat is designed to support (marking tasks complete, checking who's around, reading house notes). Users' verbalizations during these brief interactions reveal whether the interface supports the rapid, lightweight coordination that mobile and ubiquitous computing should enable







# Evaluation 0 - Results for collaborative cooking platform
Task 1 – Discover and Join a Cooking Group
Please imagine you want to cook socially with others. Look through the available cuisine groups for example, Mexican or Indian. Choose a group to join and send a request.
As you go, tell me what you’re looking for in a group and why you’d choose one over another.

Task 2 – Explore Group Details
Now that you’ve chosen a group, please open its details. Look at the ingredients, the recipe being cooked, and the number of participants.
 Talk out loud about what makes this group appealing or unappealing to you.
 
Task 3 – Collaborate Through Comments
Within your group’s recipe video, please leave a suggestion or modification, like changing an ingredient.
 Tell me how useful you think it is to comment and read others’ suggestions.

**Task Results**

**Task 1**
45 sec
Completed
Observations : Spent time checking the details mentioned. Had concerns regarding-who are the members, food choices - do they eat meat or not, are they comfortable to be around.

**Task 2**
30 sec
Completed
Observations : Was looking for more personalized information like food choices, budget

**Task 3**
30 sec
Completed
Observations : Appreciated the idea



**Post interview insights**

Q1. How easy or difficult was it to find and join a cooking group?
“Yes! It was easy to navigate and look through the groups, dishes.”

Q2. Was it clear what steps you needed to take to join or create a group?
“ Yes, the steps were clear enough, but before clicking join, I would  like to know the members, what their food preferences are like, I mean are they vegetarian or not, any allergies. I would feel comfortable if my vibe matches with them.”

Q3. Did the group details (ingredients, participants, recipes) give you enough information to decide whether to join?
 “The details were clear but I would want to see things like budget, allergy info, as I said food preferences, or even cooking responsibilities. Just knowing the dish or ingredients isn’t enough for me to decide. It would be good if they are from the same cultural background like me since it will be easier to discuss recipes with them”
 
Q4. What made a group feel appealing or unappealing to you?
 “Appealing if I share vibes or food habits with the people like as I said similar cultural background or food preferences. Unappealing if it feels they are strangers or not cooperative, if there’s no clarity on how tasks or costs are shared”
 
Q5. How comfortable would you feel collaborating with others through this platform?
 “I’d feel comfortable if I knew the people and felt comfortable cooking with them. Also, time constraints are there. I prefer easy meal recipes that take less time to cook. I don’t know how other people usually cook food.”
 
Q6. Would you prefer joining existing groups or creating your own? Why?
 “I would be open to cooking with other people like sometimes. But usually I prefer cooking alone or even with my friends as I am comfortable with them,they know my preferences, so ya. Also budget constraints are there, we usually have an idea of each other's budget. We also sometimes share groceries ”
