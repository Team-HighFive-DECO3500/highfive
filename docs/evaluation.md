### KitchenKat Evaluation Protocol

### 1. Evaluation Methodology

### Think Aloud Protocol with Post-Interview

We have decided to use Think Aloud method combined with semi-structured post-interview questions as our evaluation methodology. This approach well-suited for evaluating KitchenKat's social and mobile computing dimensions.

### Rationale for Think Aloud Protocol

**Why Think Aloud?**

Think aloud protocol is an evaluation method where participants verbalize their thoughts, feelings, and actions while interacting with the system (Ericsson & Simon, 1993). For KitchenKat, this method offers several advantages:

1. **Captures thought process and mental models**

Think aloud reveals users' expectations, confusions, and decision-making processes as they happen (Nielsen, 1993). Since KitchenKat expects to provide ambient awareness (Schmidt, 2002), we need to understand whether users naturally understand the system's information architecture without extra guidance. The protocol allows us to identify situations or moments where the design successfully fades into the background versus moments where it requires unexpected cognitive effort.


2. **Reveals Social Interpretation**

KitchenKat is fundamentally a social coordination tool designed to make invisible articulation work visible (Schmidt & Bannon, 1992). Think aloud is useful in understanding how users interpret social cues embedded in the interface such as tasks, presence indicators (avatars), and activity feeds. As users verbalize their reactions to seeing housemates' contributions, we gain insight about whether the design successfully promotes social translucence (Erickson & Kellogg, 2000) or creates unecessary pressure and discomfort.


3. **Contextual Insights**

The system operates across through multiple contexts like physical wall-mounted device in the kitchen and through mobile notifications. Think aloud allows us to observe how users navigate this ubicomp environment (Weiser, 1991; Abowd & Mynatt, 2000) and understand their context-switching behaviors. Participants' verbalized thoughts reveal their mental models about when and how to use different interaction modes.

4. **Highlights Fairness Perceptions**

A core design goal is addressing Grudin's disparity problem (Grudin, 1988, 1994) which is about ensuring those who do the work receive recognition. Think aloud captures participants' immediate reactions to fairness mechanisms like tasks UI ("reported by Cora") and visible contribution tracking. Their comments reveal whether these features feel motivating, fair, stressful, or potentially divisive.

5. **Identifies Mobile Micro-Interaction Patterns**

Think aloud is particularly effective for evaluating mobile micro-interactions (Oulasvirta et al., 2005) - the quick, glanceable actions KitchenKat is designed to support (marking tasks complete, checking who's around, reading house notes). Users' thoughts ("oh! there's a notification" or "how I do I mark this as complete") during these brief interactions reveal whether the interface supports the rapid, light coordination that mobile and ubiquitous computing should enable.

### 2. Evaluation Protocol


### Participant Recruitment


**Target Participants**: Students or young adults currently living in shared accommodation (student housing, share houses, or early-career rentals)

**Inclusion Criteria**:


- Currently share kitchen facilities with 2+ housemates
- Have experienced coordination challenges in shared living
- Comfortable with basic mobile and touchscreen technology

### Session Structure


**Duration**: 15-20 minutes per participant
**Location**: Simulated kitchen environment with wall-mounted display(laptop) showing KitchenKat prototype

**Materials**:


- Functional KitchenKat prototype on tablet/screen
- Consent forms, asking for consent verbally and information sheets
- Mobile phone for recording audio (with participant permission)
- Observer Sheets to take notes


### Protocol Stages

**Stage 1: Introduction (5 minutes)**

1. Welcome and consent process


Brief explanation of think aloud method: "Please speak your thoughts out loud as you interact with the system - what you're looking at, what you're thinking, what you expect to happen. There are no right or wrong actions."
Warm-up think aloud exercise (e.g., "Show me how you would make a cup of tea while thinking aloud")
Context setting: "Imagine you live in a share house with 4-5 other people who use this kitchen."


**Stage 2: Think Aloud Tasks (10 mins)**


- Participants complete 4 scenario-based tasks while thinking aloud and observer takes notes as they interact with the system.


1. **Task 1: Bin Full - Task Creation & Awareness**


**Scenario**: "You've just walked into the shared kitchen and noticed the bin is full. You want to use KitchenKat to handle this."


**Observable Behaviors**:


- Navigation to task creation
- Understanding of task categories and priorities
- Awareness of other housemates' tasks
- Reaction to seeing others' contributions


2. **Task 2: Notification Response & Supply Reporting**


**Scenario**: "You are Cora. You've just entered the kitchen and see a notification on the KitchenKat screen. You missed the text notification on your phone earlier. After dealing with the bin, you mark the task as complete and you notice the dish soap is nearly empty."

**Observable Behaviors**:


- Interpretation of notification system
- Process of marking tasks complete
- Navigation to SupplyWorm
- Understanding of supply status categories
- Awareness of Recent Activities feed and own contribution


3. **Task 3: House Notes & Self-Assignment** 


**Scenario**: "You left some utensils on the kitchen table this morning because you were rushing to uni. You want to leave a quick note to your housemates. You're also planning to go grocery shopping later and want notice a supply report created on KitchenKat by another housemate."

**Observable Behaviors**:


- Finding and using House Notes
- Integration of supply list into shopping plans


4. **Task 4: General Information Consumption**


**Scenario**: "You've just entered the kitchen to make a quick coffee. You're not here to do any particular task."


**Observable Behaviors**:

- Glancing at KitchenKat and understanding the information
- Glanceability and ambient awareness
- Use of avatar presence indicators
- Reading vs. skipping House Notes
- Attention patterns across interface elements


**Stage 3: Post-Interview Questions**


Semi-structured interview with 5 questions.

**Post-Interview Questions**

- **Question 1: General feedback** : What was your overall impression of using KitchenKat today? Would you want this in your actual shared accommodation? Why or why not?


- **Question 2: Social Coordination & Awareness** : Can you describe how you knew what was happening in the kitchen without directly asking anyone?


*Follow up questions*: What information helped you understand the household situation? How did this compare to how you usually coordinate with housemates?


*Theoretical Focus: Schmidt's awareness, Weiser's calm technology, asynchronous coordination*

- **Question 3: Fairness & Visibility** : You saw that tasks are assigned to individuals - like 'reported by Cora' or task initials. What are your thoughts on that?


*Follow up questions*: Fair? Motivating? Stressful? Would you prefer anonymous reporting?


*Theoretical Focus: Grudin's fairness, Schmidt, K., & Bannon, L. (1992) articulation work*


- **Question 4: Mobile & Ubiquitous Computing** : The system can send notifications to your phone, but also displays information on the kitchen screen. How do these two ways of getting information feel different to you?


*Follow up questions*: Which would you prefer when? Why have both?


*Theoretical Focus: Context awareness (Satyanarayanan)*


- **Question 6: Comparative & Adoption**: How is using KitchenKat different from your household WhatsApp group or group chat?


*Follow up questions*: Better? Worse?


- **Question 7: Any other thoughts**: Do you have any other feedback that you would like to share?


*Follow up questions*: Anything that felt confusing or improved your experience? Improvements? 


**Stage 4: Closing**


### 3. Data Collection methods


- Audio Recording (with consent)
- Observer Notes

### 4. Results for Think aloud and Post Interview

#### Participant 1 (P1)



***Transcripts are attached in***

**Task Performance Summary**
- **Task 1 (Bin Overflow)**: Successfully navigated to Task Manager, understood task creation process, and considered notification mechanisms.
- **Task 2 (Notification Response & Supply Report)**: Checked Task Manager for duty assignments, navigated to Supply Stock to report dish soap shortage, understood assignment system.
- **Task 3 (House Notes & Shopping)**: Correctly identified House Notes for communication, used Supply Stock to check shopping needs, demonstrated understanding of dual functionality.
- **Task 4 (Glancing)**: Effectively scanned interface, understood task assignments, supply status, and house notes without explicit interaction.


#### Participant 2 (P2) - Observations

- Missed notification initially, relied on Task Manager to create tasks
- Found task creation easy but interface took time to understand
- Noticed Recent Activities and House Notes features
- Questions raised: "Can I edit flatmates' names?"
- Felt Task Manager was cluttered with too much text
- Prefers both mobile and physical screen modalities
- Wants notification when kitchen becomes empty
- Values system over group chat: "No need to nag someone," but hesitates to call people out


**Key Insights**


**Strengths**

1. **Fairness benefits** - Addressing Grudin's Disparity Problem
- Both participants immediately recognized the fairness benefits:

- P1: "Without the system, it'd be really hard to know if someone has done the duty or not"
- P2: "Better than group chat - no need to nag someone"

This validates our core design goal of making invisible work visible (Schmidt & Bannon, 1992) and addressing Grudin's (1988) disparity between who does work and who benefits.


2. **Social concept Accepted**

 
-P1 on names being visible: "By calling the names, we would be more... responsible for the situation"
- Accountability mechanisms viewed as positive, not intrusive



3. **Multi-Modal Interaction Validated**
- Both participants strongly preferred having both screen and mobile notifications:

- P1: "You're always using your phone... doing it both ways is like a very good option"
- Confirms context-aware computing needs
- Validates ubicomp approach over single-device design



4. **Awareness Achieved (Partially)**
- P1 on glanceability: Could understand "whose task is what" and "if we need any supply stock" through brief scanning


5. **Superior to Existing Communication Methods**
- P1: "In the group chat, some people just don't respond... with kitchen cat, they would be more responsible"
- Validates "beyond being there" principle (Hollan & Stornetta, 1992)
- Asynchronous, persistent visibility more effective than synchronous messaging


**Critical Issues & Improvements Needed**


1. **Notification Visibility Failure** : P2 missed notification entirely
- Design flaw: Notifications should be visible clearly but not seem like a punishment


- Recommendation: Increase notification prominence through size, color contrast, animation, or positioning


2. **Information Overload & Text-Heavy Design**
- Consistent across both participants:
- P1: "If there would be more pictures, it would be easy to comprehend"
- P2: "Task Manager cluttered, too much text"
- Tradeshow feedback: "Supplies are too text heavy"
  

- Recommendations:
- Replace text descriptions with icons/images for supplies
- Use visual hierarchy and progressive disclosure
- Implement task previews instead of full descriptions
- Add pictorial representations for common items



3. **Learning Curve & Initial Confusion**
- P2: "Took some time to understand the interface"
- Suggests poor information architecture
- Contradicts goal of natural, intuitive interaction



- Recommendation: Simplified onboarding, clearer visual hierarchy, reduced initial cognitive load



4. **Lack of Editability & Control**
- P2 questioned: "Can I edit flatmates' names?"
- Users want control over household configuration
- System feels rigid without customization options



- Recommendation: Add household member management features, editable profiles, customizable categories



5. **Task Manager Perceived as Cluttered**
- Both participants defaulted to Task Manager for everything, but:
- P2: "Task Manager cluttered"
- Users forced into one interface for multiple needs
- Navigation burden contradicts micro-interaction goals


- Recommendation:
- Separate urgent tasks into prominent dashboard widget
- Use filtering/sorting options ("show my tasks only" - from tradeshow feedback)
- Reduce clicks needed to access critical information



6. **Queue Feature Demand**
- P2: "Prefers to get notified when kitchen is empty"
- Tradeshow feedback on queue curiosity


- Recommendation: Prioritize kitchen queue implementation in next iteration

### 5. Feedback from Tradeshow

**Tradeshow Overview**

**Demonstration Setup**


For the tradeshow, we created a tangible prototype to demonstrate KitchenKat's core functionality:


- Physical Bin Prototype: A cardboard box depicting the smart bin with paper sensors and coloured marks to demonstrate the sensor-based alert system
- Kitchen Display: A cardboard screen featuring a poster of the KitchenKat interface to simulate the wall-mounted kitchen display
- Interactive Demo: Laptop and iPad used for hands-on interaction with the functional prototype
- Engagement: Demonstrated to 4+ visitorFeedback Summary

### Feedback Results

**Quantative Feedback**

 - **Clarity of Purpose**: 70%+ understood what KitchenKat is designed to do
 - **Ease of Understanding**: 60%+ found the main screen and features easy to understand
 - **Fairness Perception**: 60%+ agreed that KitchenKat helps people share kitchen work fairly
 - **Social Connection**: 60% felt the app was "somewhat social" in connecting people
- **Privacy Comfort**: 100% felt comfortable with the information shared (initials, updates) shared on screen


**Qualitative Results**


**Key Strengths Identified**


 - **Privacy comfort**: All participants felt comfortable with the level of information sharing, validating our approach to social translucence
 - **Fairness Concept**: Majority recognized the system's potential to promote equitable household work distribution
 - **Clear Value**: Most visitors quickly grasped KitchenKat's purpose in supporting shared living coordination


**Issues identified**

1. **Navigation** : Users experienced "information overload" and unclear navigation paths


- ***Quotes from the form*** : "I felt confused on where to go initially... there wasn't a clear path", "Having to click in to see what is needed - makes it easy to ignore - previews of task would be good - not just the urgent ones" , "It was unclear what user I was logged in as, and how to change users."

2. **Task Visibility & Glanceability** : Critical information requires too many interactions to access

-  ***Quotes from the form*** : "Having to click in to see what is needed - previews of task would be good"

3. **Supply Management Visibility** : Supply information is text-heavy and buried in navigation

- ***Quotes from the form***: "In the SUPPLY STOCKS section, the information display (such as the urgency of out-of-stock items) relies heavily on text and is not placed on the main page, which may cause users to overlook it and thus undermine its intended purpose."

4. ***User Identity Confusion*** : Unclear which user is logged in and how to switch users

- **Quotes from the form**: "It was unclear what user I was logged in as, and how to change users"

5. ***Queue Feature Curiosity*** : Multiple visitors expressed interest in the kitchen queue feature (future work)

# Evaluation 0 - Results for collaborative cooking platform
Task 1 – Discover and Join a Cooking Group
Please imagine you want to cook socially with others. Look through the available cuisine groups for example, Mexican or Indian. Choose a group to join and send a request.
As you go, tell me what you’re looking for in a group and why you’d choose one over another.

Task 2 – Explore Group Details
Now that you’ve chosen a group, please open its details. Look at the ingredients, the recipe being cooked, and the number of participants.
 Talk out loud about what makes this group appealing or unappealing to you.
  
Task 3 – Collaborate Through Comments
Within your group’s recipe video, please leave a suggestion or modification, like changing an ingredient.
 Tell me how useful you think it is to comment and read others’ suggestions.

**Task Results**

**Task 1**
45 sec
Completed
Observations : Spent time checking the details mentioned. Had concerns regarding-who are the members, food choices - do they eat meat or not, are they comfortable to be around.

**Task 2**
30 sec
Completed
Observations : Was looking for more personalized information like food choices, budget

**Task 3**
30 sec
Completed
Observations : Appreciated the idea



**Post interview insights**

Q1. How easy or difficult was it to find and join a cooking group?
“Yes! It was easy to navigate and look through the groups, dishes.”

Q2. Was it clear what steps you needed to take to join or create a group?
“ Yes, the steps were clear enough, but before clicking join, I would  like to know the members, what their food preferences are like, I mean are they vegetarian or not, any allergies. I would feel comfortable if my vibe matches with them.”

Q3. Did the group details (ingredients, participants, recipes) give you enough information to decide whether to join?
 “The details were clear but I would want to see things like budget, allergy info, as I said food preferences, or even cooking responsibilities. Just knowing the dish or ingredients isn’t enough for me to decide. It would be good if they are from the same cultural background like me since it will be easier to discuss recipes with them”
 
Q4. What made a group feel appealing or unappealing to you?
 “Appealing if I share vibes or food habits with the people like as I said similar cultural background or food preferences. Unappealing if it feels they are strangers or not cooperative, if there’s no clarity on how tasks or costs are shared”
 
Q5. How comfortable would you feel collaborating with others through this platform?
 “I’d feel comfortable if I knew the people and felt comfortable cooking with them. Also, time constraints are there. I prefer easy meal recipes that take less time to cook. I don’t know how other people usually cook food.”
 
Q6. Would you prefer joining existing groups or creating your own? Why?
 “I would be open to cooking with other people like sometimes. But usually I prefer cooking alone or even with my friends as I am comfortable with them,they know my preferences, so ya. Also budget constraints are there, we usually have an idea of each other's budget. We also sometimes share groceries ”
