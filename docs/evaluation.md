Task 1 – Discover and Join a Cooking Group
Please imagine you want to cook socially with others. Look through the available cuisine groups for example, Mexican or Indian. Choose a group to join and send a request.
As you go, tell me what you’re looking for in a group and why you’d choose one over another.

Task 2 – Explore Group Details
Now that you’ve chosen a group, please open its details. Look at the ingredients, the recipe being cooked, and the number of participants.
 Talk out loud about what makes this group appealing or unappealing to you.
 
Task 3 – Collaborate Through Comments
Within your group’s recipe video, please leave a suggestion or modification, like changing an ingredient.
 Tell me how useful you think it is to comment and read others’ suggestions.

**Post interview insights**

Q1. How easy or difficult was it to find and join a cooking group?
“Yes! It was easy to navigate and look through the groups, dishes.”

Q2. Was it clear what steps you needed to take to join or create a group?
“ Yes, the steps were clear enough, but before clicking join, I would  like to know the members, what their food preferences are like, I mean are they vegetarian or not, any allergies. I would feel comfortable if my vibe matches with them.”

Q3. Did the group details (ingredients, participants, recipes) give you enough information to decide whether to join?
 “The details were clear but I would want to see things like budget, allergy info, as I said food preferences, or even cooking responsibilities. Just knowing the dish or ingredients isn’t enough for me to decide. It would be good if they are from the same cultural background like me since it will be easier to discuss recipes with them”
 
Q4. What made a group feel appealing or unappealing to you?
 “Appealing if I share vibes or food habits with the people like as I said similar cultural background or food preferences. Unappealing if it feels they are strangers or not cooperative, if there’s no clarity on how tasks or costs are shared”
 
Q5. How comfortable would you feel collaborating with others through this platform?
 “I’d feel comfortable if I knew the people and felt comfortable cooking with them. Also, time constraints are there. I prefer easy meal recipes that take less time to cook. I don’t know how other people usually cook food.”
 
Q6. Would you prefer joining existing groups or creating your own? Why?
 “I would be open to cooking with other people like sometimes. But usually I prefer cooking alone or even with my friends as I am comfortable with them,they know my preferences, so ya. Also budget constraints are there, we usually have an idea of each other's budget. We also sometimes share groceries ”
