# Research Summary

This document brings together insights from literature, student interviews, and observations of shared kitchens. It explains why healthy eating is difficult in shared living and highlights opportunities for a social, mobile tool.

## Scope of Research

We reviewed recent studies on Australian food environments and healthy-eating communication [R1][R2]. We also interviewed students living in shared housing (18–25 years old) and reflected on our own shared kitchen experiences. This mixed approach follows the DECO3500 expectation to ground prototypes in both academic and user-centred data before Week 9.

## Participants

- Age: 18–25
- Context: university students living in shared housing
- Patterns: cooked a few times per week, preferred meals ≤30 minutes, aimed for “healthy and tasty” but often defaulted to convenience
- Sources: YouTube and peers for recipes
- Collaboration: rare without coordination, but described as “fun” when it happened

These patterns align with our earlier audience analysis and pain points.

## Key Themes

- **Time:** quick prep and minimal clean-up were top priorities. Fatigue often led to skipping cooking.
- **Budget:** eating out was avoided for cost/hygiene reasons [R3], but solo grocery shopping caused waste.
- **Health & Taste:** important but often overridden by convenience at the last moment.
- **Decision fatigue:** “What should we cook?” was a recurring frustration.
- **Coordination:** cooking together only worked when duties and timing were made clear.

## Literature Insights

- Australian research shows cost and visibility strongly shape food choices [R1][R2][R3].
- Healthy options are often less visible or harder to act on quickly.
- Guidance can feel abstract, but narrative formats (e.g., blogs) improve relatability [R5].
- Evidence suggests people respond best to simple, actionable prompts at decision time rather than heavy tracking [R4][R6].

## Observations of Shared Kitchens

- **Bottlenecks:** peak congestion at lunch and dinner.
- **Environment:** limited space, mixed-quality tools.
- **Fairness:** unclear cleaning/shopping rotations led to tension.
- **Food waste:** leftovers and ingredients often discarded due to lack of planning.

A lightweight way to plan meals, divide duties, and reuse leftovers would ease friction.

## Why a Social, Mobile Solution

Decisions often happen in motion (on the way home, in a queue, or when housemates overlap). A phone-first tool with visible coordination and lightweight reminders can:

- Reduce decision fatigue with a small set of options.
- Show availability of housemates in real time.
- Split roles (prep, cook, clean) fairly.

This aligns with course guidance to demonstrate multi-user, contextual interactions rather than build a full product at this stage.

## Design Takeaways

1. Keep actions short and clear at the point of choice.
2. Make group coordination the default, not an optional extra.
3. Support health without framing it as medical advice.
4. Respect budgets and show savings where possible.
5. Reduce mess with simple duty rotation and leftover use.

_This summary will be updated as more tests are run with interactive prototypes._
