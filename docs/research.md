# Research Summary

This document brings together what we learned from early literature, interviews, and quick observations of shared kitchens. It explains what students are dealing with, why healthy eating slips, and where a social, mobile tool could help.

## What we looked at

We reviewed recent work on Australian food environments and healthy-eating communication [R1][R2], then spoke with students who live in shared housing. We also reflected on our own kitchen experiences to understand peak times, clashes, and clean-up routines. This mix follows the DECO3500 expectation to ground the prototype in both literature and user data gathered before Week 9.

## Who we heard from

Participants were 18–25 and living with housemates. Most cooked a few times a week, aimed for “healthy and tasty,” and preferred meals that take 30 minutes or less. Many used YouTube for ideas and cooked alone by default, but were open to cooking with friends when coordination was easy. These patterns match our design-proposal snapshots of the audience and pain points.

## What matters most

**Time** dominates choices. People want quick prep and minimal clean-up, and long steps are the main irritation. **Budget** is the next filter; eating out is seen as expensive and sometimes unhygienic [R3]. **Health and taste** matter, but convenience often wins at the last minute. Cooking together works well when duties and timing are clear; without that, deciding “what to make” becomes tiring. These themes appear across our interviews and align with our earlier design slides.

## Signals from the literature

Australian studies show that cost and visibility strongly shape everyday food choices [R1][R2][R3]. Healthy options are often harder to see quickly, and formal guidance can feel abstract [R2][R4]. Professional blogs sometimes make advice feel more “human” through stories and tips, but their alignment with official guidelines varies [R5]. In short, people respond best to simple, actionable prompts at the moment of choice rather than heavy tracking or long-form education.

## What we observed

Shared kitchens bottleneck at lunch and dinner. Space is tight, tools are mixed quality, and “who cleans what” is unclear. Ingredient sharing happens informally and leads to waste when no one plans around leftovers. A lightweight way to plan, divide tasks, and reuse what’s already there would remove friction.

## Why this points to a social, mobile solution

Decisions are made fast — in the queue, on the way home, or when housemates finally overlap. A phone-first tool that offers a small set of good options, shows who’s available, and splits duties (prep, cook, clean) can turn good intentions into action. That focus also reflects the course guidance to demonstrate a multi-user, contextual experience rather than a full product at this stage.

## Takeaways that shape the design

1. Keep actions short and clear at decision time.
2. Make group coordination the default, not an afterthought.
3. Support health without acting like medical advice.
4. Respect budgets and show savings where possible.
5. Reduce mess with simple duty rotation and leftover use.

_This summary will be updated as we run more tests on the interactive prototype._
