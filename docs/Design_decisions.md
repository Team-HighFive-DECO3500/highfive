Design Opportunity:

From our research, we identified several design opportunities:

Reduce decision fatigue by supporting shared meal planning.

Save time and money through collective shopping and cooking.

Increase motivation by creating small group challenges (e.g., veggie meals for 3 days).

Ensure fairness and accountability by tracking tasks (shopping, cooking, cleaning).


Refined Design Opportunity:

To create a display + mobile system that coordinates everyday household tasks (shopping, cooking, cleaning) in shared accommodations, while sending reminders and keeping a visible trace of contributions, to support fairness, motivation, and social accountability.

3. Early Concepts and Iterations
   
Concept 1: Fridge-Mounted Ingredient Screen
What we imagined:

 A screen attached to the fridge that detects ingredients inside (through manual input or scanning) and shows recipes based on available items + expiry dates.


Why:
 We wanted to reduce food waste and help students quickly decide on meals.


What we realised:
 The idea had potential for efficiency, but it lacked a clear social interaction component. Each person could use it alone, without collaboration. It risked becoming “just another recipe app” on a screen.


Concept 2: Shared Scale + Ingredient Display
What we imagined:
 A shared kitchen scale with a mounted display board. Each housemate could scan or enter the ingredients they had. The display would then combine everyone’s inputs and suggest quick, collective recipes.


Why:
 This version started to embed collaboration, students could see a shared pool of ingredients and cook together.


How we tested:
 We created low-fidelity prototypes (sketches, paper mock-ups) and later digital wireframes in Figma.


What we found during evaluation:

Users were confused about how the system worked.

The recipe suggestions were too abstract and didn’t feel actionable.

Testers reported that while it was “interesting,” it wasn’t clearly more useful than existing apps.


Reflection:

 The teaching team also confirmed our suspicion: although the idea had a shared element, it still wasn’t strongly social enough. The technology was doing the work, but not encouraging people to interact with each other.


Concept 3: Collaboration Display Board for Shared Living

What we pivoted to:
 Based on feedback, we zoomed in on a smaller but more social pain point: household task management in shared living. Instead of focusing only on food/recipes, we designed a display board + mobile notification system for shared tasks (grocery shopping, cooking turns, cleaning, garbage disposal).


Why this worked better:


It directly addressed the interview insight that “people forget tasks after 1–2 weeks.”

It introduced visible accountability; everyone could see who had done their part.

Notifications supported mobile computing by reminding individuals, while the board displayed social traces of contributions.

It kept the scope manageable while staying deeply tied to social and mobile computing principles.


4. Prototyping Journey
   
Low-fidelity: Paper sketches of group selection, task assignment and task completion screens.

Medium-fidelity: Figma prototypes tested with classmates; iterations included clearer task assignment flow and a progress-tracking trace.

Feedback: Users appreciated the fairness tracking and reminders more than recipe generation. They said the system “felt like a shared calendar, but specific to house tasks.”

Next Steps: Moving toward higher-fidelity prototypes, integrating both mobile notifications and a shared display board to balance personal reminders and social visibility.
