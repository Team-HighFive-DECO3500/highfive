# Experience Requirements

This document lists the first draft of user experience requirements based on our research. These requirements show what the prototype must demonstrate now, and what it should support as we iterate. They follow the DECO3500 brief to define experience requirements early and refine them through evaluation before the tradeshow.

---

## Experience goals

The prototype should make shared cooking feel quicker, cheaper, and easier than going solo. It should reduce decision fatigue at the moment of choice [R1][R3], help housemates agree on a meal without back-and-forth, and make the clean-up plan obvious [R2].

---

## Core capabilities (for the prototype)

The system should let a household propose a meal, see who is available, and confirm a time in just a few taps. It should include a small recipe set filtered by preparation time (≈30 minutes), budget cues, and simple dietary tags [R1][R5]. Each confirmed meal should automatically assign basic roles (prep, cook, clean) so everyone knows what to do. A lightweight ingredient check should help avoid waste and make use of what is already in the kitchen [R4]. These flows are enough to demonstrate the social and mobile concept without needing a full product build.

## Mobile and social context

The interface should be phone-first and easy to use on the move. Availability and quick polls should update in real time so groups can decide quickly. Notifications should stay minimal and useful (e.g., “Two housemates free at 7:30, confirm pasta?”) rather than overwhelming users [R6].

---

## Inclusivity and tone

Guidance should feel supportive, not preachy. The design must acknowledge different diets and budgets and avoid medical claims [R5]. Content should be plain, respectful, and culturally aware, reflecting the diversity of students in shared housing.

---

## Privacy and safety (initial stance)

The system should only collect information needed to coordinate a meal (such as names, availability, and simple preferences). Data should be visible only to the household by default, and the platform should avoid storing sensitive health details. A clear disclaimer should explain that any nutrition information is general and not medical advice [R2]. These choices reflect the course expectation to identify ethical risks early in the wiki.

---

## What we are not building (for now)

For the Week-9 and Week-12 milestones, we are not building calorie tracking, complex login systems, or full grocery integrations. If needed, these non-core features will be simulated so we can focus on the social and contextual experience first.

---

## How we will judge success

We expect to see faster decisions (for example, picking a meal in under five minutes), more shared meals completed, fewer last-minute takeaways, and less confusion around cleaning. We will also look for simple signs of inclusion (such as dietary options being selected without friction) and positive feedback about reduced stress [R1][R3][R5].

_These requirements will be refined after user testing on the interactive prototype and before the tradeshow demo._
