# **Design Process Overview**

## **Project Introduction**

KitchenKat is a digital wall-mounted display designed to support household coordination in shared student accommodation and sharehouses. The system helps housemates manage kitchen tasks, track supplies, and stay aware of household activities through a calm, ambient interface that reduces friction and promotes fairness in shared living spaces. Rather than adding complexity to already busy student lives, KitchenKat acts as a quiet background presence that makes invisible household work visible and ensures everyone contributes fairly to shared domestic responsibilities.

## **Design Principles**

Our design is grounded in core principles of social and mobile computing that shaped every decision throughout the development process. From a **social computing perspective**, we focused on **awareness** by making invisible household work visible through activity traces and task status. We emphasized **coordination** to support asynchronous collaboration without requiring constant communication between housemates. Our approach addresses **articulation work** by reducing the cognitive effort of dividing, allocating, and tracking household responsibilities. **Fairness** was central to our design, ensuring equitable distribution of domestic labour through transparent task assignment. We also embraced **social translucence**, carefully balancing visibility and accountability with privacy and comfort so the system feels supportive rather than surveillant.

From a **mobile computing perspective**, we designed KitchenKat to be **context-aware**, responding intelligently to household presence, patterns, and needs. The system provides **ambient information** by displaying relevant details peripherally without demanding constant attention. We implemented **just-in-time support** that provides assistance at the moment of need, such as when someone enters the kitchen. Most importantly, we ensured **seamless integration** so the technology fits naturally into existing household routines rather than disrupting them. These principles guided us away from complex feature-heavy designs toward a calm, supportive system that truly serves the social dynamics of shared living.

## **Initial Concept and Evolution**

### **First Iteration: Collaborative Cooking Platform**

Our initial design focused on a collaborative cooking platform where users could scan ingredients they owned, join cuisine-specific cooking groups, chat with group members to coordinate recipes, collectively create shopping lists and divide cooking tasks, and comment on and modify shared recipes. At first glance, this seemed like a comprehensive solution to healthy eating in shared accommodation. However, as we developed this concept further and presented it to tutors, significant challenges emerged that forced us to reconsider our entire approach.

The first major challenge was **complexity**. We had created a system with too many features that caused cognitive overload for users who simply wanted to figure out what to eat for dinner. The **critical mass problem** became evident as the system required many active users to provide value, falling directly into **Grudin's Challenge #2** about groupware adoption. There was also a **work-benefit disparity** where early adopters had to do significant work through scanning items and entering data with minimal immediate benefit in return, exemplifying **Grudin's Challenge #1**. Most critically, tutors noted the design was not sufficiently social. Despite having many collaborative features, we had focused on functionality rather than supporting actual social coordination practices that happen naturally in shared households.

### **Design Pivot: From Complexity to Calm Coordination**

Following tutor feedback and deep reflection on course readings, particularly Schmidt's critique of vague "awareness" concepts and Grudin's fairness principles, we returned to our research findings and design opportunities. We realized the core coordination challenge wasn't about forming cooking groups or generating recipes. It was about making everyday household maintenance visible, fair, and effortless. We had been designing for an idealized version of shared living rather than the messy, busy reality students actually experience.

Key insights emerged from revisiting our annotations and research. Students struggle with **decision fatigue** and **unclear responsibility distribution**, not with finding recipes online. Invisible domestic labour causes resentment when some housemates contribute more than others, creating tension that undermines the social bonds we wanted to support. Effective coordination requires **ambient awareness** without intrusive notifications, as Schmidt argued in his 2002 paper. Most importantly, we learned that systems must provide **immediate individual value**, not just collective benefits, because people won't maintain systems that only benefit the group at their personal expense, as Grudin explained in 1994. These insights fundamentally redirected our design toward simplicity and situational support.

## **Current Design: KitchenKat**

### **Core Functionality**

The **dashboard** serves as the main screen providing at-a-glance household awareness through four key components carefully designed to support peripheral attention:

- **Urgent alerts** use smart sensor integration to display immediate needs like *“Bin is full—needs taking out—Kiran”* with attribution that makes responsibility clear without being accusatory.  
- **Task manager preview** uses color-coded status indicators showing what's urgent, due this week, and scheduled monthly.  
- **Supply stock** provides three-tier visibility showing urgent needs, items running low, and well-stocked supplies to prevent shortages.  
- **Recent activities** display activity traces that create gentle accountability and recognition for completed work, addressing the invisible labour problem.  
- **House notes** enable lightweight asynchronous communication for quick reminders and updates, replacing fridge notes with persistent visible messages.

The **task manager** allows housemates to create tasks with categories like cleaning, supplies, cooking, maintenance, and organization. Users set priority levels (immediate, this week, or monthly) to reduce decision fatigue. Tasks can be assigned manually or via an automated roster for fair distribution. The **drag-and-drop completion interface** makes finishing tasks feel satisfying, while **individual attribution** ensures everyone’s contributions are visible without creating competition.

**SupplyWorm** manages household supplies through a friendly, non-judgmental interface. Users report supply issues with urgency levels (low, empty, expired). Community notes provide context for shared updates, while attribution distributes the mental load of tracking supplies evenly. Visual indicators support **glanceable awareness**, reinforcing mobile computing principles of ambient information.

### **Design Rationale**

Our current design addresses previous challenges by restructuring how value is created and distributed. The system requires **no account setup** or **complex onboarding**, respects users’ time, and ensures **every interaction provides personal value**. Automatic activity logging removes manual updates, directly addressing **Grudin’s work-benefit problem**.  

We designed for **natural practices**, not new behaviours. **Asynchronous coordination** respects varying schedules, aligning with **Hollan & Stornetta’s “Beyond Being There”**. **Peripheral awareness** implements **Weiser’s calm technology** vision. **Persistent artifacts** like task lists enable grounding without requiring synchronous presence, drawing on **Clark & Brennan’s communication framework**.  

**Fairness** remains central: attribution ensures recognition, colour-coding reduces decision fatigue, and mascots distribute cognitive load. These embody **Grudin’s principle** of balancing who does work with who benefits.

## **Evaluation and Iteration**

### **Think-Aloud Protocol (Week 9)**

We conducted **usability testing** with shared-house students using **scenario-based tasks** (responding to alerts, reporting supplies, navigating notes). Participants verbalised thoughts following **Nielsen’s 1993 framework**.  

Findings showed users liked the mascots’ friendly tone, attribution (“reported by Cora”) promoting accountability, and drag-and-drop completion as intuitive and satisfying. Issues included navigation clarity and visual hierarchy, which were refined by simplifying layouts, enlarging key info, and improving iconography. These changes ensured the interface became more **glanceable and intuitive** while retaining warmth.

### **Tradeshow Exhibition (Week 12)**

Public testing at the **tradeshow** confirmed KitchenKat’s concept and ethics resonated.  
- **70%** understood the system’s purpose instantly.  
- **60%** found the interface intuitive and fair.  
- **100%** were comfortable with privacy handling.

Qualitative feedback pinpointed **navigation, task preview, and supply layout** as pain points. In response, we:  
- Reduced text density using icons.  
- Added **task previews** on the dashboard.  
- Introduced **colour-coded user profiles** for clarity.  
- Simplified **supply status icons** for glanceability.  

These refinements demonstrated **evidence-based iteration** grounded in user feedback.

## **Theoretical Foundations**

Our design is anchored in **CSCW and mobile computing theory**:

- **Schmidt (2002)** – Designed for specific awareness types (task, contribution, supply) instead of vague “awareness.”  
- **Grudin (1988, 1994)** – Ensured fairness and early user value, addressing work-benefit symmetry and critical mass.  
- **Clark & Brennan (1991)** – Supported grounding through reviewability, revisability, and evidence of understanding.  
- **Hollan & Stornetta (1992)** – Designed beyond replication of face-to-face; leveraged digital persistence and selective attention.  
- **Loke & Matthews (2020)** – Embedded ethics from the start, ensuring transparency, consent, inclusivity, and emotional well-being.  
- **Winner (1980)** – Recognised that artifacts reflect social values and power, shaping our privacy and attribution choices.

## **Conclusion**

KitchenKat evolved from a complex, feature-heavy prototype into a **focused coordination tool** grounded in theory and ethics. It exemplifies **DECO3500 learning outcomes**, demonstrating the bridge between **theory and practice** through rigorous iteration.  

Our project shows that meaningful social computing design is not about adding features but about **deeply understanding social contexts** and **supporting coordination naturally**. By grounding every stage in evidence, user testing, and critical reflection, KitchenKat stands as both a **functional prototype** and a **case study in theory-informed interaction design**.
