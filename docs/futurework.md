# Future Work

Following our tradeshow exhibition and user feedback sessions, we identified several key areas for improvement and expansion. These refinements aim to enhance usability, scalability, and the overall user experience of KitchenKat as it evolves from a concept prototype into a more robust, context-aware coordination tool for shared living.

## Immediate Improvements

### Kitchen Queue Coordination
The "Join Queue" feature will be fully implemented to let users signal kitchen availability and coordinate access in real time. During testing, students living in larger sharehouses noted that meal times often overlap, leading to congestion and frustration. The queue system will reduce conflicts by showing who's next in line, providing gentle reminders, and visualising kitchen flow. This supports KitchenKat's goal of promoting fairness and reducing friction in communal spaces.

### Individual Task Views
Feedback showed that the single shared task sheet was overwhelming. Users found it difficult to locate their personal responsibilities or see task ownership at a glance. Future iterations will introduce individual task cards or task-specific pop-ups, each linked to a user's profile. This will support transparency, accountability, and quick task recognition without visual clutter.

### Visual Task Creation Interface
The current "Create Task" screen relies heavily on text input, which testers described as "too much typing." We plan to replace this with a tap-based, visual interface using icons like refrigerators, mops, kettles, and bins. This approach will speed up task creation, minimise errors, and make the interface more playful and accessible, particularly for quick, repetitive chores.

## Medium-Term Enhancements

### Iconography & Visual Language
Consistent visual icons will be introduced across all screens to strengthen wayfinding and reduce cognitive load. Cleaning, cooking, mopping, rubbish, and supply tasks will be colour-coded and symbol-based, creating an intuitive system of visual cues. This aligns with mobile UX best practices for fast, glanceable interactions.

### Streamlined Task Assignment Flow
Currently, adding and assigning a task requires navigating through multiple steps. We plan to collapse this into a single, fluid action where users can create, categorise, and assign a task in one gesture. This simplification directly addresses feedback about friction and improves responsiveness for mobile users managing tasks on the go.

### Notification & Reminder System
A lightweight notification layer will be added, focusing on subtle prompts rather than intrusive alerts. It will include gentle reminders about upcoming or overdue tasks, "kitchen free now" notifications from the queue, and shared milestone updates like "all tasks complete for the week." Notifications will be customisable so users retain control over frequency.

### Progress Tracking & Fairness Indicators
We aim to build simple analytics dashboards that visualise household balance, showing who's been completing tasks, what remains, and how effort is distributed. This gamified element can motivate participation and prevent conflict by making contributions visible without feeling competitive.

## Long-Term Vision

### Expanded Scope Beyond the Kitchen
While KitchenKat currently focuses on kitchen and cooking tasks, user interviews revealed that cleaning and maintenance responsibilities often overlap. Future releases will expand to cover the full household system, including bins, laundry, floor cleaning, shared groceries, and fridge management. This would transform KitchenKat into a comprehensive shared living companion.

### Scalability & Usability Testing
We plan to test KitchenKat in larger households with 5 to 8 members to examine how it scales. This testing will help us refine navigation hierarchies, prioritisation systems, and group visibility controls. Insights from these studies will inform whether features like sub-groups or "room clusters" are needed.

### AI-Assisted Task Recommendations (Exploratory)
In the long term, we will explore lightweight AI features such as automatically suggesting recurring tasks based on household routines (like "Mop Mondays") or detecting imbalances in participation. While exploratory, this could make the platform proactive rather than purely reactive.

## Iterative Development Approach

Each improvement will be developed and tested in short design and test cycles, using feedback from the same student living contexts that inspired the project. Future sprints will focus on balancing simplicity and depth, maintaining KitchenKat's approachable tone while expanding its capability. Our guiding principle remains the same: to make coordination in shared living effortless, fair, and social rather than administrative.
