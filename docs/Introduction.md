Students living in shared accommodations often struggle to maintain consistent healthy eating habits due to a combination of time pressures, budget limitations, lack of cooking knowledge, and decision fatigue. While eating out is perceived as costly and unhealthy, cooking at home is seen as healthier and more affordable, yet difficult to sustain regularly.

Our project, developed under the theme of Social and Mobile Computing, explores how digital tools and shared experiences can motivate students to adopt healthier cooking practices. Specifically, we aim to design a social cooking coordination platform that reduces friction in meal planning, supports collaboration among housemates, and promotes affordable, nutritious meals.

Through a combination of literature review, user interviews, and iterative prototyping, we identified time, money, and collaboration as the three dominant factors shaping studentsâ€™ food habits. These insights helped us refine our design opportunity: building a lightweight, social, and mobile-first system that not only manages tasks like shopping and cooking duties, but also fosters community and shared responsibility around healthy eating
