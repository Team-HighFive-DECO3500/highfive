**KitchenKat**


**Overview**

KitchenKat is a digital wall-mounted display designed to make household coordination in shared student accommodation effortless and fair. Instead of relying on forgotten WhatsApp messages or overlooked fridge notes, KitchenKat provides a persistent, ambient interface that helps housemates manage kitchen tasks, track supplies, and stay aware of household activities—all without nagging, surveillance, or creating new burdens.

**The Problem**

**Students living in sharehouses face constant coordination challenges:**

Invisible labour: Some housemates do more work while others don't realize what needs doing

Decision fatigue: "What should we cook?" paralysis leads to expensive takeaway defaults

Supply chaos: Running out of essentials or wasting groceries because no one's tracking inventory

Cleanup friction: Post-cooking mess deters shared cooking that could save money and build community

Communication gaps: Group chats get cluttered, fridge notes get ignored, and tension builds

Current tools aren't built for the messy reality of shared living. They either demand too much effort (detailed chore apps that nobody maintains) or provide too little structure (group chats where important information gets lost).

**Our Solution**

KitchenKat sits quietly in the background as a wall-mounted display in shared kitchens, making coordination visible without being intrusive:

**Core Features**

**Task Manager**

Create, assign, and track household tasks with clear priorities. Drag-and-drop completion makes finishing tasks satisfying. Everyone sees who's doing what, preventing both duplicated effort and invisible labour.

**SupplyWorm**

Report and track supply issues (running low, empty, expired) with urgency indicators. Attribution shows who noticed problems, distributing mental load fairly across the household.

**House Notes**

Leave persistent reminders and updates that don't get lost in group chat scrollback. Simple, visible communication for the little things that matter.

**Smart Alerts**

Connected to kitchen sensors (like smart bins) that automatically detect when something needs attention. "Bin is full—needs taking out—Kiran" makes needs visible with friendly attribution.

**Activity Traces**

Recent activities create gentle accountability and recognition for completed work. Everyone's contributions become visible, building fairness and appreciation.

**Design Principles**

KitchenKat is built on principles from social and mobile computing research:

Awareness without surveillance: See what needs doing and who's contributing, without tracking or judgment

Immediate individual value: Every interaction helps you personally, not just the group

Asynchronous coordination: Respect varied schedules—no need for meetings or real-time chat

Fair work distribution: Make invisible labour visible and ensure everyone contributes

Calm technology: Information is there when you need it, invisible when you don't


**Who It's For**

Students in shared accommodation juggling classes, work, and social lives

Young professionals in sharehouses navigating communal living for the first time

Any household where coordination feels harder than it should be


**Development Journey**

KitchenKat emerged from rigorous research into healthy eating habits among university students. We discovered the real barrier wasn't nutrition knowledge or recipe access—it was coordination infrastructure. Through interviews, literature review, and iterative prototyping informed by CSCW theory, we evolved from a complex cooking platform to this focused coordination tool.

**Key milestones:**

Research phase identifying coordination pain points in shared kitchens

Initial prototype with scanning, groups, and recipe features (too complex)

Design pivot based on evaluation and theoretical reflection

Current prototype focused on task coordination and supply management

Tradeshow exhibition with public feedback and iteration


**Technology Stack**

Interface Design: Figma for prototyping and visual design

Interaction Paradigm: Wall-mounted display (primary) with mobile companion app (future)

Theoretical Foundation: Schmidt (awareness), Grudin (fairness), Clark & Brennan (grounding), Hollan & Stornetta (beyond being there)

**Project Vision**

"Technology should make shared living easier, not add another thing to manage. KitchenKat keeps the kitchen in flow by making coordination visible, fair, and effortless."

We believe good design fades into the background, supporting the social rhythms of shared life without demanding attention or creating new friction. KitchenKat represents our attempt to build technology that serves people rather than the other way around.
