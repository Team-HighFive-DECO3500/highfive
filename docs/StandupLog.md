# Week 8

We finalised our concept called Shared Scale + Ingredient Display, which was a collaborative kitchen system that allowed housemates to scan or enter their available ingredients. The shared display would pool all inputs and suggest quick, collective recipes. We created low-fidelity sketches and paper mock-ups, then moved on to developing digital wireframes in Figma. During user evaluation, participants expressed confusion about how the system actually functioned and found the recipe suggestions too abstract and not actionable enough. Although the idea was considered "interesting," users noted that it wasn't clearly more useful than the recipe apps they already use. The teaching team feedback reinforced this view, describing our concept as "not social enough." This prompted us to seriously revisit our design direction and think more deeply about what collaborative cooking actually means for students.

# Week 9

In response to the feedback, we took a step back and re-evaluated our entire design opportunity. We shifted focus towards the broader theme of sharing responsibilities in student households/shared accomodations, not just cooking. Through short interviews and informal discussions with flatmates and peers, we discovered that students typically use WhatsApp, Instagram or a roster fridge-based schedules to coordinate chores. However, these methods tend to lose effectiveness after just a few weeks when people get busy or forget to check. Building on this insight, we started designing a digital wall-mounted display board to visualise shared responsibilities. The idea was to show who is accountable for what, who has completed tasks and what remains pending. This stage involved sketching new layouts and interaction flows, with the goal of creating more meaningful social engagement within shared living spaces. We wanted something that felt present in the home, not hidden away in an app that people might ignore.

# Week 10

We began refining our design into a more interactive and socially connected prototype. The revised concept incorporated activity traces, which are subtle visual cues showing recent household actions like task completions or updates. We applied key social and mobile computing principles such as visibility, accountability and calm awareness. These principles helped us maintain awareness of what others are contributing without creating pressure or feeling intrusive. We also worked hard on connecting our design decisions back to theory and the evaluation feedback we'd received. It felt important to justify why each feature existed and how it supported collaboration. The week concluded with developing the final annotated prototype and linking it to core theoretical principles like collaboration, social presence, and situated awareness. By this point, the design felt much more grounded in real user needs and actual household dynamics.
