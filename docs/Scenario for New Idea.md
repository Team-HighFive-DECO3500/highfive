### **Scenario 1 – The Morning Rush**

Sarah walks into the kitchen at 7:30 AM, already running late for work. She notices the coffee machine is empty. For a moment, she considers skipping it but then remembers Mike’s note from last night: “Coffee machine running low.” She decides to quickly refill the water tank, knowing others will need coffee too. With her cup in hand, she heads out the door and notices the shopping note about milk. She makes a mental plan to pick some up after work.
Her goal isn’t to “press a refill button,” but to make sure the shared morning routine isn’t disrupted. The board quietly enabled this sense of responsibility and continuity in the household.

**Task Results**
**Time:** \~1 min
**Completed**
**Observations:** Coffee refill done quickly; noticed shared shopping note; continuity of the routine maintained.

### **Scenario 2 – Leftovers & Shared Living**

Mike cooked pasta the night before and had half a pot of sauce left. Not wanting it to go to waste, he left a quick note: “Pasta sauce in fridge, help yourself \:D.” The next evening, Emma comes home tired and hungry after class. She spots Mike’s note, heats up the sauce, and enjoys a quick dinner without cooking. Later, she cleans the dishes and replies on the board: “Tasty, thanks Mike!”
Mike’s goal was to avoid waste and share something with his housemates. Emma’s was to save time and effort on dinner. The board became a small bridge of generosity and gratitude in their shared life.

**Task Results**
**Time:** \~45 sec
**Completed**
**Observations:** Avoided food waste; saved Emma cooking effort; encouraged gratitude and reciprocity.

### **Scenario 3 – The Weekend Cleanup**

By Saturday, the trash bin has been full for days, and the counters are sticky from a busy week of cooking. The board highlights: “Sink area: 3 days since last cleaning. Try a quick 10-min tidy?” Sarah, noticing this, starts a cleanup session. Tom joins from the living room, and Emma comes down to help too. Within minutes, they split tasks, clear counters, wipe surfaces, and empty the trash. When they mark it done, a little celebratory animation appears.
The real achievement wasn’t “tapping Mark Complete,” but restoring a sense of order and togetherness. The board helped transform a looming chore into a short, cooperative moment.

**Task Results**
**Time:** \~2 min
**Completed**
**Observations:** Prompt sparked teamwork; chores finished quickly; positive feedback reinforced collaboration.

### **Scenario 4 – Cooking Queue**

Mike is in the kitchen making dinner. Emma comes back from class, hungry, but she doesn’t want to crowd the space. The board shows: “Mike cooking, \~15 min left.” Instead of waiting around, Emma stays in her room, finishes some emails, and only heads down when she gets a notification that the kitchen is free. She cooks her pasta without stress or conflict.
Her goal wasn’t to “join a digital queue,” but to manage her time and avoid friction with a housemate. The board quietly mediated the space, giving everyone a smoother rhythm.

**Task Results**
**Time:** \~30 sec
**Completed**
**Observations:** Avoided conflict; managed waiting time productively; smoother shared kitchen flow.
