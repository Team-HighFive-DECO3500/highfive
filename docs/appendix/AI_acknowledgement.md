### AI Acknowledgement & Critical Reflection

Artificial intelligence (GPT-5) was used during this project as a **supportive analytical and writing tool**. Its role was mainly to help with **structuring ideas, verifying interpretations**, and **checking theoretical alignment** across key design concepts such as *Glanceability*, *Context Awareness*, and *Politics of Artifacts*.  

AI assistance was also used for **language clarity and synthesis**, suggesting better phrasing, transitions, and concise summaries of complex ideas. However, all **interpretive depth, thematic analysis, and theoretical framing** were based on the researcher’s **own independent critical understanding** of the data and literature.  

In the technical development stage, tools like ChatGPT supported **code refinement** in selective areas—such as *drag-and-drop logic*, *localStorage setup*, and *page linking* between dashboard, task manager, and supply view. All AI-generated code was **reviewed, tested, and modified** to ensure originality, accuracy, and alignment with **UQ academic integrity standards**. Core logic, interface design, colour schemes, and user interactions were **human-developed and conceptually designed by the author**.  

This process demonstrates both the **utility and limitation of AI**: while it improves organisation, precision, and consistency, the **interpretation, critical reasoning, and creative insight** remain entirely human responsibilities. AI was used ethically and transparently, following **UQ’s Responsible Use of AI in Assessment** guidelines.

### Example Prompts Used

To ensure transparency, some example questions asked to AI during the project included:

- “How can I connect *Context Awareness* and *Politics of Artifacts* more clearly in my findings?”  
- “Please refine this paragraph for better academic flow.”  
- “Show me a clean example of JavaScript localStorage handling for task data.”  
- “How do I link multiple pages (dashboard → tasks → supplies) with consistent navigation?”  
- “Can you simplify this sentence without losing meaning?”  
- “How can I make this reflection sound more critical and analytical?”

### Summary

> AI tools were used as **supportive assistants** for writing clarity, structural organisation, and minor coding logic.  
> All **conceptual, analytical, and design decisions** were made by the researcher.  
> This approach follows **UQ’s integrity and ethical AI use standards**, ensuring transparency, originality, and responsible authorship.
