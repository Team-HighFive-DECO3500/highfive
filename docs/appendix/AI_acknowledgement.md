### AI Acknowledgement & Critical Reflection

Artificial intelligence (GPT-5) was used as a supplementary analytical tool to support the verification and synthesis of insights across participant data. It assisted in cross-checking theoretical alignments (e.g., Glanceability, Context Awareness, and Politics of Artifacts) and in refining the articulation of key findings.

However, the interpretive depth, thematic connections, and theoretical framing were grounded in the author’s independent critical analysis. AI involvement was primarily instrumental—helping to structure and clarify thought rather than generate original insights. This reflective collaboration highlights both the utility and limitation of AI in research: while it enhances precision and consistency, genuine understanding, contextual judgment, and theoretical nuance remain inherently human processes.
